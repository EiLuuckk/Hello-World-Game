# Hello-World-Game

Hi, I'm Lu√≠s Henrique, I'm 18 years old, I'm a beginner in programming (23/01/2021) and 
I intend to make a game! I still don't know what I'm going to do! I am writing 
about it elsewhere to start developing!

That's my initial message! Oh, and don't forget to drink water, okay?
